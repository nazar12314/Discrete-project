I am an extraordinarily ordinary woman who has lived an extraordinary life. For a little while, the world of my everyday became the place where the religious go to confront their genesis; I went to be reborn there. I walked ancient lands of ageless beliefs where the patriarchs and pariahs, messengers and messiahs, the baptized and the baptizers of my religious upbringing once lived and breathed, loved and learned and died. I met the modern-day Philistines—the people of Goliath—and the descendants of the Assyrians and Nubians, too. I stood in the Red Sea and the Dead Sea and climbed the mountain from which Moses saw the Promised Land. I bought gold, frankincense, and myrrh in a dark and moody alleyway where one of the three wise men once stood and visited the little chapel in Cairo that covered the cave where the baby Jesus had escaped Herod’s brutality. Their collective stories shaped my early life, and the desert lands of their descendants reshaped it when I was well into adulthood. I became new in the wild waste of the unforgiving desert sands as they swirled and curled into columns of biting, burning heat.
On the Arabian peninsula, camels plodded through drifting dunes, the wild, vibrant-hued birds of the desert sands whistled and shrieked and cawed, and jellies of gelatinous blue spread out on the sharp sands of the Arabian Gulf; I passed them all on my daily comings and goings. I ate meals of lamb and flat bread cooked over open charcoal fires that singed my nostrils while I sat on colorful ground pillows. I listened to the wholehearted laughter of desert women in black abayas and matching head coverings and discovered meaning in kohl-lined eyes even as I learned to distinguish and then use the harsh, guttural words and phrases of the people of the Quran. They both encouraged and mocked my attempts at their language.
